# Where can I publish my Data?

A number of options exist for where, or by which method, you can publish a research dataset. These include publishing your dataset in a dedicated data journal paper, as part of a journal paper submission (for journals that embed data publishing into their submission workflow), or by directly publishing your data in an online data repository (including those repositories specific to your scientific discipline, general-purpose repositories, or in a repository provided by your local institution).        

When choosing which pathway to publish your data, it can be important to consider the following in choosing a data publication pathway most suitable for you:

- Does your research funding body stipulate where or how you should publish datasets originating from that funding?
- If publishing data as part of a journal publication process, does the journal mandate or recommend a particular data publishing location, or provide data publication services as part of the wider journal publication process? 
- Are there community norms within your scientific discipline when it comes to publishing data? For example, is a specific domain-targeted repository typically used?
- The volume of data contained within your dataset
- Will your dataset evolve over time, and thus require your dataset publication to be versioned?

At UNSW the following guidelines, in order of priority, help you choose where best to publish your research dataset. Note howvere that these are guidelines only and there may be occasions where they do not apply. Please contact us should that be the case.  

## 1. When it comes to publishing data, it is important that you follow any policies or guidance, if existing, specified by your funding body or journal. 

Your funding body may state that you must deposit your data in a specific repository, or that you must use the data deposit functionality built into a journal's submission workflow. You should also follow any associated policies around file formats and metadata requirements.

## 2. Consider a data journal which can expand the reach and impact of your dataset. 

A data journal is a scholarly publication allowing researchers to publish publications which describes the information content and reuse potential of one or more data collections. Its purpose is to build awareness and use of data made available to the wider research community, rather than discuss a research argument or hypothesis. Data creators who publish a data paper will gain academic credit by having their paper published in a peer-reviewed journal.

## 3. Use a Data Repository

If your funding body or journal (if applicable) does not stipulate where or how you should publish your data, and you are not intending to publish a data paper, then you will most likely want to publish your dataset in a repository. A __data repository__ is an online storage platform, typically hosted by an institution or by a cloud-based service provider, where researchers can upload, document and publicise datasets produced by their research. A large number of data repositories exist today, with some catering to specific scientific disciplines, and others providing general-purpose data publishing services.
