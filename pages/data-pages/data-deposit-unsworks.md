# Publishing data using UNSWorks

[UNSWorks](https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au) is UNSW's Institutional Repository. It is used for providing open access to a variety of research output types, including research data and software. 

## Checklist

Before proceeding with publishing your dataset in UNSWorks, please read the following points:

- UNSWorks is suitable for relatively small datasets (up to a maximum of approximately 5GB). If you are publishing a dataset larger than this then you should consider a more suitable data repository. Information about other available repositories can be found [here.](/publishing-data/)
- If you require a full curation service for your dataset you are encouraged to use the [Dryad](https://datadryad.org) repository. Dryad, which UNSW researchers can use freely through a University subscription, will help you curate your dataset and aid in producing a high-quality dataset.
- Versioning
- Private Links and Embargo
- Ensure your dataset and metadata have been suitably prepared for publication and open access. For more information, check out [Preparing your data for publication](/preparing-your-data/) 

## Steps to publish your data in UNSWorks.

- Navigate to the UNSWorks homepage at [https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au](https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au) and click on __Login__ in the top right corner to log in with your University credentials.

- Once logged in, hover over the __Deposit__ link on the top bar and click on __Deposit a dataset__ in the dropdown to open the Dataset deposit form.

### Deposit License Section

- Read the _Deposit license_ section and click the _I confirm the license above_ tickbox to confirm that you agree with each statement. 

>> {: .danger }
It is important that you read fully and agree to the terms of the Deposit license before proceeding with depositing your data into UNSWorks. If you need further infomation regarding any of the terms please [contact us](/contact/). 

### Description Section

- Complete the __Title__ of your dataset. Remember to use a title that reflects the actual dataset itself as opposed to the title of an associated journal publication for example.

- Fill in the __Publication date__ of the dataset. This will typically be today's date (assuming you are publishing this dataset for the first time). Whilst you can fill in the current _year_ only, it is beneficial to complete the _month_ and _day_ also.

- Complete the __Description__ of the dataset. Aim to give as much information here as possible to ensure the data can be as easily understood and re-usable by other researchers. For more information on how to construct a good Dataset description, click [here](/preparing-your-dataset/)

- Whilst not mandatory, it can be beneficial to fill out information about the dataset __Methodology__ (if you haven't already done this as part of the _Description_), giving further information about how the dataset was collected or derived.

- Add any __Keywords__ that may be relevant to the dataset and that may aid discovery of the dataset. Use the _Add more_ link to add multiple keywords.

- Add any __Fields of Research (FoR) codes__ relevant to the dataset. To add an FOR code, use the _Search_ icon on the right of the field to open up the FOR lookup panel. Click into the relevant field codes to select the 6-digit code. Use the _Add more_ link to add further FOR codes.   

[![UNSWorks FOR Code dropdown]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/UNSWorks-FORCode-Dropdown.png){: width="600" }{:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border: 1px solid black;"}]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/UNSWorks-FORCode-Dropdown.png){:target="_blank"}

<br/>

- Add any __Socio-Economic Objective (SEO) codes__ relevant to the dataset. To add an SEO code, use the _Search_ icon to the right of the field to open up the SEO lookup panel. Click into the relevant codes to select the 6-digit code.  Use the _Add more_ link to add further SEO codes.   

- If applicable, add information about the __Geographic coverage__ of the dataset. This could for example be the point location of a particular set of measurements, the detailed bounding box co-ordinates of a field site, or could simply be an address.

- If your dataset covers a specific time period, enter the year, month and day in the __Time Period - From__ and __Time Period - To__ fields. Alternatively, or in addition, you can provide a textual description of the dataset's time period in the __Time Period - Description__.

- If useful, select the __Language__ used within the dataset.

### Contributors Section

- Add any UNSW-based __Research Data Creator(s)__, i.e. those who were directly involved in the creation of the dataset. To add a researcher, click on the _Search_ icon to the right of the field to open the search panel. In the search box, enter the details of the researcher you would like to add as data creator. You can use either the researcher's name, zID or ORCID (noting that in the case of zID or ORCID you should surround the string in " "). Tick the box next to the correct creator in the search listings, and click _Close_. That researcher should now appear in the dataset creator list. Use the _Add more_ link to add further _Research Data Creators_.  

[![UNSWorks Choose creator]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/UNSWorks_Choose_Creator.png){: width="600" }{:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border: 1px solid black;"}]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/UNSWorks_Choose_Creator.png){:target="_blank"}

<br/>

- As with _Research Data Creators_ above, add any other UNSW-based contributors to the dataset using the __Other Contributor(s)__ field. These may be people who aided the generation of the dataset, without having explicitly generated any of the data themselves.   

- Add any __Corporate/Industry Contributor(s)__ who have added or contributed to the dataset. 

- Add the name and affiliation of those non-UNSW data creators in the __Non-UNSW Contributor(s) Name / Affiliation__ field.

### Storage, Access and Rights Section

{: .note }
It is highly recommended that datasets are either directly uploaded into UNSWorks as part of the dataset submission, or an external data repository DOI is used for data situated elsewhere online. The long-term integrity of non-DOI links to datasets situated elsewhere, either online or physically, can not be assured and is thus not encouraged, unless under specific circumstances.  

- To create a dataset record in UNSWorks for data that is available at a specific web address complete the __Electronic location__ field using a full web address (http://..., https://..., etc)   

- If the dataset being documented is stored on physical media as opposed to online, give a full description of that __Physical Location__.

- In circumstances whereby you are not directly uploading the data into UNSWorks, or providing a DOI to an external repository, then please provide useful __Contact Information__ (noting that this information will be publicly available).

- If the dataset has already been published elsewhere with a DOI, please enter that DOI in the __External Data Repository DOI__ field. 

- Select a reuse __License__. Note that the use of a CC-BY license (or CC0) is highly encouraged for datasets. To read more about the choise of license, see [here](https://subjectguides.library.unsw.edu.au/open-access/publishing/datasets)

- By default, UNSW will be listed as the __Rights holder__ to datasets published in UNSWorks. To discuss different arrangements please get in touch.  

### Related item(s) Section

The _Related item(s)_ section allows you to associate your dataset with any directly related items, including __Related Dataset(s)__, __Related Publication(s)__ and/or __Related Grant/Project(s)__, whether they themselves are in UNSWorks or available at another online location. For each, use the _search_ icon on the right of the field to look up associated records in UNSWorks, or add a link (ideally a DOI) directly into the field.     

### Upload files

To upload your dataset's files, you can either:
1. Drag and Drop your files from you local computer directly onto the Upload files panel
2. Use the __browse files__ link or __My Device__ icon to choose files on your local system
3. Use the __Link__ button to download files directly from a web link

_(Note that the 'Google Drive' option is currently unsupported and users should refrain from using this file upload mechanism)_

[![UNSWorks File Upload Panel]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/unsworks_file_upload_panel.png){: width="600" }{:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border: 1px solid black;"}]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/unsworks_file_upload_panel.png){:target="_blank"}

- __You must also include a _ReadMe_ file as part of your uploaded files__, that documents your dataset in addition to the descriptions given on the UNSWorks submission form. For more information about dataset ReadMe files and how to create one, please see the section on [Data ReadMe files](/readme-files/).

- Once you have uploaded all your files you can click on _Done_ at the bottom of the file upload panel.

### File Edit

The _file edit_ panel (located at the bottom of the page) allows you to:
- provide a file-level description for a file that you have uploaded
- change the default open-access status of any files

To open the _file edit_ panel, click on the _Edit file_ icon to the right of each uploaded file (at the bottom of the page).

{: .note }
You are encouraged to publish files open-access (as per the default). If you choose to make a file _private_ or _embargoed_, you must explain the reasoning for this. 


## Dataset Review Process and Next Steps  

When you click on the __Deposit__ button on your UNSWorks dataset (and assuming there are no errors in your upload form), your dataset will be forwarded for review to the UNSW dataset review panel. During this process, UNSW dataset review personnel will:
- check that the dataset is of a suitable quality (that is, will check that sufficient detail has been provided so that that dataset will be understood and reusable by others)
- check that the dataset contains actual dataset files, and where possible check that these files are saved in a non-proprietary format.
- check that a README file has been included and that it contains relevant information.
- potentially make small edits or additions to the record's metadata to help enrich the dataset.   

If there are major edits or corrections to be made to the record, the review panel will email the uploader and ask for further information.
