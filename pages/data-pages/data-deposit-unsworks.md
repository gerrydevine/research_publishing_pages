# Publishing data using UNSWorks

[UNSWorks](https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au) is UNSW's Institutional Repository. It is used for providing open access to a variety of research output types, including research data and software. 

## Checklist

Before proceeding with publishing your dataset in UNSWorks, please read the following points:

- UNSWorks is suitable for relatively small datasets (up to a maximum of approximately 5GB). If you are publishing a dataset larger than this then you should consider a more suitable data repository. Information about other available repositories can be found [here.](/publishing-data/)
- If you require a full curation service for your dataset you are encouraged to use the [Dryad](https://data-dryad.org) repository. Dryad, which UNSW researchers can use freely through a University subscription, will help you curate your dataset and aid in producing a high-quality dataset.
- Versioning
- Private Links and Embargo
- Ensure your dataset and metadata have been suitably prepared for publication and open access. For more information, check out [Preparing your data for publication](/preparing-your-data/) 

## Steps to publish your data in UNSWorks.

- Navigate to the UNSWorks homepage at [https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au](https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au) and click on __Login__ in the top right corner to log in with your University credentials.

- Once logged in, hover over the __Deposit__ link on the top bar and click on __Deposit a dataset__ in the dropdown to open the Dataset deposit form.

- Read the _Deposit license_ section and click the _I confirm the license above_ tickbox to confirm that you agree with each statement. 

>> {: .danger }
It is important that you read fully and agree to the terms of the Deposit license before proceeding with depositing your data into UNSWorks. If you need further infomation regarding any of the terms please [contact us](/contact/).  

- Complete the __Title__ of your dataset. Remember to use a title that reflects the actual dataset itself as opposed to the title of an associated journal publication for example.

- Fill in the __Publication date__ of the dataset. This will typically be today's date (assuming you are publishing this dataset for the first time). Whilst you can fill in the current _year_ only, it is beneficial to complete the _month_ and _day_ also.

- Complete the __Description__ of the dataset. Aim to give as much information here as possible to ensure the data can be as easily understood and re-usable by other researchers. For more information on how to construct a good Dataset description, click [here](/preparing-your-dataset/)

- Whilst not mandatory, it can be beneficial to fill out information about the dataset __Methodology__ (if you haven't already done this as part of the _Description_), giving further information about how the dataset was collected or derived.

- Add any __Keywords__ that may be relevant to the dataset and that may aid discovery of the dataset. Use the _Add more_ link to add multiple keywords.

- Add any __Fields of Research (FoR) codes__ relevant to the dataset. To add an FOR code, use the _Search_ icon on the right of the field to open up the FOR lookup panel. Click into the relevant field codes to select the 6-digit code. Use the _Add more_ link to add further FOR codes.

<br/>

- Add any __Socio-Economic Objective (SEO) codes__ relevant to the dataset. To add an SEO code, use the _Search_ icon to the right of the field to open up the SEO lookup panel. Click into the relevant codes to select the 6-digit code.  Use the _Add more_ link to add further SEO codes.   

- If applicable, add information about the __Geographic coverage__ of the dataset. This could for example be the point location of a particular set of measurements, the detailed bounding box co-ordinates of a field site, or could simply be an address.

- If your dataset covers a specific time period, enter the year, month and day in the __Time Period - From__ and __Time Period - To__ fields. Alternatively, or in addition, you can provide a textual description of the dataset's time period in the __Time Period - Description__.

- If useful, select the __Language__ used within the dataset.

## README file

## Dataset Review Process and Next Steps  

When you click on the _Publish_ button on your UNSWorks dataset (assuming no errors in your upload form), your dataset will be forwarded for review to the UNSW dataset review panel. During this process, UNSW dataset review personnel will:
- check that the dataset is of a suitable quality (that is, will check that sufficient detail has been provided that that dataset will be understood and reusable by others)
- check that the dataset contains actual dataset files, and where possible check that these files are saved in a non-proprietary format.
- check that a README file has been included and that it contains relevant information.
- potentially make small edits or additions to the record's metadata to help enrich the dataset.   

If there are major edits to be made to the record, the review panel will email the uploader and ask for further information.
