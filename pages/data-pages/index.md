# Publishing Research Data
<p class="fs-6 fw-300">Data publishing is the process of making your research data (or information about that data) openly available and discoverable online so that the data can be accessed and reused by others. This practice has been shown to have many benefits, both for you as the researcher publishing their data, and the wider research community.
