## Data Repositories 

A __data repository__ is an online storage platform, typically hosted by an institution or by a cloud-based service provider, where researchers can upload, document and publicize datasets produced by their research. There are a large number of data repositorys available today, some catering to specific scientific disciplines, with others providing general-purpose data publishing.
