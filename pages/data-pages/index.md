# Publishing Research Data
<p class="fs-6 fw-300">Data publishing is the process of making your research data (or information about that data) openly available and discoverable online so that the data can be accessed and reused by others. This practice has been shown to have many benefits, for you as the researcher publishing their data, the wider research community, and for the general public.

The following sections provide information and guidance around the topic of research data publishing at UNSW, and include advice around how to prepare your data for publishing, how and where to publish your data, and how to promote your published data once it is available in a data repository.
