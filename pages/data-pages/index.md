# Publishing Research Data
<p class="fs-6 fw-300">Sharing data publicly maximises potential benefits to the research community by enabling other researchers to find and reuse your data. It also enhances your profile and provides opportunities for future research collaborations. Funders and publishers increasingly expect researchers to publish the data associated with their research.

The following sections provide information and guidance around the topic of research data publishing at UNSW, and include advice around where to publish your data, how to prepare your data in advance of publishing, and how to promote your published data once it is available in a data repository.
