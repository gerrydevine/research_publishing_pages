# Where can I publish my Data?

A number of options exist for where, or by which method, you can publish a research dataset. These include publishing your dataset in a dedicated data journal paper, as part of a journal paper submission process (for journals that offer data publishing as part of their submission process), or by directly publishing your data in an online data repository (including those specific to your scientific discipline, general-purpose repositories, or provided by your local institution).        

When choosing which pathway to publish your data, it can be important to consider:

- Does your research funding body stipulate where or how you should publish datasets originating from that funding?
- If publishing data as part of a journal publication process, does the journal mandate or recommend a particular data publishing location, or provide data publication services as part of the wider journal publication process? 
- Are there community norms within your scientific discipline when it comes to publishing data?


At UNSW the following guidelines are in place to aid in choosing whre best to publish your research dataset. Note that these are guidelines only and there may be occasions when your dataset falls outside of these. Please contact us if that is the case.  

## 1. When it comes to publishing data, it is important that you follow any policies, if existing, specified by your funding body or journal editors. 

This may state that you must deposit your data in a specific repository, or that you must use the data deposit functionality built into a journal's submission workflow. You should also follow any associated policies around file formats and metadata requirements.

## 2. Consider a data journal which can expand the reach and impact of your dataset. 

A data journal is a scholarly publication allowing researchers to publish publications of medium length containing a non-technical description of a dataset and putting the data in a research context. Each paper gets a persistent identifier providing publication credits to the author.

Examples include _Scientific Data_, _PLOS One_, and _Data in Brief_.

## 3. Use a Data Repository

A __data repository__ is an online storage platform, typically hosted by an institution or by a cloud-based service provider, where researchers can upload, document and publicize datasets produced by their research. There are a large number of data repositorys available today, some catering to specific scientific disciplines, with others providing general-purpose data publishing.
